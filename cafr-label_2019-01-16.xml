          xml:lang="en">Fund financial statements should be used to report additional and detailed information about the primary government. Governments should report governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary funds to the extent that they have activities that meet the criteria for using those funds. a. Governmental fund reporting focuses primarily on the sources, uses, and balances of current financial resources and often has a budgetary orientation. The governmental fund category includes the general fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. Governmental funds are, in essence, accounting segregations of financial resources. Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used; current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they are to be paid; and the difference between governmental fund assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, the fund equity, is referred to as "Fund Balance."</label>

          xml:lang="en">The operations of the reporting government should be presented in a format that reports the net (expense) revenue of its individual functions. Net (expense) revenue is sometimes referred to as the "net cost" of a function or program and represents the total expenses of the function or program less its program revenues—that is, charges or fees and fines that derive directly from the function or program and grants and contributions that are restricted to the function or program. An objective of using the net (expense) revenue format is to report the relative financial burden of each of the reporting government's functions on its taxpayers. This format identifies the extent to which each function of the government draws from the general revenues of the government or is self-financing through fees and intergovernmental aid. This notion of burden on the reporting government's taxpayers is important in determining what is program or general revenue. General revenues, contributions to term and permanent endowments, contributions to permanent fund principal, special and extraordinary items, and transfers should be reported separately after the total net expenses of the government's functions, ultimately arriving at the "change in net position" for the period. At a minimum, the statement of activities should present:

a.    Activities accounted for in governmental funds by function to coincide with the level of detail required in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances

b.    Activities accounted for in enterprise funds by different identifiable activities.</label>

Examples of infrastructure assets include roads, bridges, tunnels, drainage systems, water and sewer systems, dams, and lighting systems. Buildings, except those that are an ancillary part of a network of infrastructure assets, should not be considered infrastructure assets for purposes of this section.</label>

          xml:lang="en">Program-specific grants and contributions (operating and capital) include revenues arising from mandatory and voluntary nonexchange transactions with other governments, organizations, or individuals that are restricted for use in a particular program. Some grants and contributions consist of capital assets or resources that are restricted for capital purposes—to purchase, construct, or renovate capital assets associated with a specific program. These should be reported separately from grants and contributions that may be used either for operating expenses or for capital expenditures of the program at the discretion of the reporting government. These categories of program revenue are specifically attributable to a program and reduce the net expense of that program to the reporting government. For example, a state may provide an operating grant to a county sheriff's department for a drug-awareness-and-enforcement program or a capital grant to finance construction of a new jail. Multipurpose grants (those that provide financing for more than one program) should be reported as program revenue if the amounts restricted to each program are specifically identified in either the grant award or the grant application. Multipurpose grants that do not provide for specific identification of the programs and amounts should be reported as general revenues.</label>

          xml:lang="en">The operations of the reporting government should be presented in a format that reports the net (expense) revenue of its individual functions. Net (expense) revenue is sometimes referred to as the "net cost" of a function or program and represents the total expenses of the function or program less its program revenues—that is, charges or fees and fines that derive directly from the function or program and grants and contributions that are restricted to the function or program. An objective of using the net (expense) revenue format is to report the relative financial burden of each of the reporting government's functions on its taxpayers. This format identifies the extent to which each function of the government draws from the general revenues of the government or is self-financing through fees and intergovernmental aid. This notion of burden on the reporting government's taxpayers is important in determining what is program or general revenue. General revenues, contributions to term and permanent endowments, contributions to permanent fund principal, special and extraordinary items, and transfers should be reported separately after the total net expenses of the government's functions, ultimately arriving at the "change in net position" for the period. At a minimum, the statement of activities should present:

a.    Activities accounted for in governmental funds by function to coincide with the level of detail required in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances

b.    Activities accounted for in enterprise funds by different identifiable activities.</label>

The “not in spendable form” criterion includes items that are not expected to be converted to cash, for example, inventories and prepaid amounts. It also includes the long-term amount of loans and notes receivable, as well as property acquired for resale. However, if the use of the proceeds from the collection of those receivables or from the sale of those properties is restricted, committed, or assigned, then they should be included in the appropriate fund balance classification (restricted, committed, or assigned), rather than nonspendable fund balance. The corpus (or principal) of a permanent fund is an example of an amount that is legally or contractually required to be maintained intact.</label>

The governmental fund category includes the general fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. Governmental funds are, in essence, accounting segregations of financial resources. Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used; current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they are to be paid; and the difference between governmental fund assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, the fund equity, is referred to as "Fund Balance."</label>

          xml:lang="en">The financial reporting entity consists of the primary government and organizations for which the primary government is financially accountable. In addition, the primary government may determine through the exercise of management's professional judgment that the inclusion of an organization that does not meet the financial accountability criteria is necessary in order to prevent the reporting entity's financial statements from being misleading. In such circumstances, that organization should be included as a component unit. The nucleus of a financial reporting entity usually is a primary government. However, a governmental organization other than a primary government (such as a component unit, a joint venture, a jointly governed organization, or an other stand-alone government) serves as the nucleus for its own reporting entity when it issues separate financial reports. Although this section is written from the perspective of the primary government, its requirements apply to the separately issued basic financial statements of governmental component units, joint ventures, jointly governed organizations, and other stand-alone governments. These organizations should apply the provisions of this section as if they were a primary government.</label>

Those committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of action (for example, legislation, resolution, ordinance) it employed to previously commit those amounts. The authorization specifying the purposes for which amounts can be used should have the consent of both the legislative and executive branches of the government, if applicable. Committed fund balance also should incorporate contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.</label>

a.    For committed fund balance: (1) the government’s highest level of decision-making authority and (2) the formal action that is required to be taken to establish (and modify or rescind) a fund balance commitment

b.    For assigned fund balance: (1) the body or official authorized to assign amounts to a specific purpose and (2) the policy established by the governing body pursuant to which that authorization is given

c.    For the classification of fund balances (1) whether the government considers restricted or unrestricted amounts to have been spent when an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is available and (2) whether committed, assigned, or unassigned amounts are considered to have been spent when an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which amounts in any of those unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used.</label>

          xml:lang="en">Program-specific grants and contributions (operating and capital) include revenues arising from mandatory and voluntary nonexchange transactions with other governments, organizations, or individuals that are restricted for use in a particular program. Some grants and contributions consist of capital assets or resources that are restricted for capital purposes—to purchase, construct, or renovate capital assets associated with a specific program. These should be reported separately from grants and contributions that may be used either for operating expenses or for capital expenditures of the program at the discretion of the reporting government. These categories of program revenue are specifically attributable to a program and reduce the net expense of that program to the reporting government. For example, a state may provide an operating grant to a county sheriff's department for a drug-awareness-and-enforcement program or a capital grant to finance construction of a new jail. Multipurpose grants (those that provide financing for more than one program) should be reported as program revenue if the amounts restricted to each program are specifically identified in either the grant award or the grant application. Multipurpose grants that do not provide for specific identification of the programs and amounts should be reported as general revenues.</label>

Revenues in this category include fees charged for specific services, such as water use or garbage collection; licenses and permits, such as dog licenses, liquor licenses, and building permits; operating special assessments, such as for street cleaning or special street lighting; and any other amounts charged to service recipients. Fines and forfeitures are also included in this category because they result from direct charges to those who are otherwise directly affected by a program or service, even though they receive no benefit. Payments from other governments for goods or services—for example, when County A reimburses County B for boarding County A's prisoners—also should be reported in this category.</label>

          xml:lang="en">Fiduciary fund reporting focuses on net position and changes in net position. Fiduciary funds should be used to report assets held in a trustee or agency capacity for others and therefore cannot be used to support the government's own programs. The fiduciary fund category includes pension (and other employee benefit) trust funds, investment trust funds, private-purpose trust funds, and agency funds. The three types of trust funds should be used to report resources held and administered by the reporting government when it is acting in a fiduciary capacity for individuals, private organizations, or other governments. These funds are distinguished from agency funds generally by the existence of a trust agreement that affects the degree of management involvement and the length of time that the resources are held. Financial statements of fiduciary funds should be reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The recognition of certain liabilities of defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans is discussed in “Pension Plans Administered through Trusts That Meet Specified Criteria—Defined Benefit,” and "Postemployment Benefit Plans (Other Than Pension Plans) Administered through Trusts That Meet Specified Criteria—Defined Benefit." Required financial statements for fiduciary funds are the statement of fiduciary net position and the statement of changes in fiduciary net position. Fiduciary fund financial statements should include information about all fiduciary funds of the primary government, as well as component units that are fiduciary in nature.</label>

          xml:lang="en">Enterprise funds (proprietary funds) may be used to report any activity for which a fee is charged to external users for goods or services. Activities are required to be reported as enterprise funds if any one of the following criteria is met. Governments should apply each of these criteria in the context of the activity's principal revenue sources.
 
 a. The activity is financed with debt that is secured solely by a pledge of the net revenues from fees and charges of the activity. Debt that is secured by a pledge of net revenues from fees and charges and the full faith and credit of a related primary government or component unit—even if that government is not expected to make any payments—is not payable solely from fees and charges of the activity. (Some debt may be secured, in part, by a portion of its own proceeds but should be considered as payable "solely" from the revenues of the activity.)
 
 b. Laws or regulations require that the activity's costs of providing services, including capital costs (such as depreciation 6 or debt service), be recovered with fees and charges, rather than with taxes or similar revenues. 
 
 c. The pricing policies of the activity establish fees and charges designed to recover its costs, including capital costs (such as depreciation or debt service).</label>

All taxes, even those that are levied for a specific purpose, are general revenues and should be reported by type of tax—for example, sales tax, property tax, franchise tax, income tax. All other nontax revenues (including interest, grants, and contributions) that do not meet the criteria to be reported as program revenues should also be reported as general revenues. General revenues should be reported after total net expense of the government's functions.</label>

Governments should report governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary funds to the extent that they have activities that meet the criteria for using those funds. Governmental fund reporting focuses primarily on the sources, uses, and balances of current financial resources and often has a budgetary orientation. The governmental fund category includes the general fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. Governmental funds are, in essence, accounting segregations of financial resources. Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used; current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they are to be paid; and the difference between governmental fund assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, the fund equity, is referred to as "Fund Balance."</label>

In addition, the primary government may determine through the exercise of management's professional judgment that the inclusion of an organization that does not meet the financial accountability criteria is necessary in order to prevent the reporting entity's financial statements from being misleading. In such circumstances, that organization should be included as a component unit. The nucleus of a financial reporting entity usually is a primary government. However, a governmental organization other than a primary government (such as a component unit, a joint venture, a jointly governed organization, or an other stand-alone government) serves as the nucleus for its own reporting entity when it issues separate financial reports. Although this section is written from the perspective of the primary government, its requirements apply to the separately issued basic financial statements of governmental component units, joint ventures, jointly governed organizations, and other stand-alone governments. These organizations should apply the provisions of this section as if they were a primary government.</label>

          xml:lang="en">The foundation of a primary government is a separately elected governing body—one that is elected by the citizens in a general, popular election. As the nucleus of the financial reporting entity, the primary government generally is the focal point for the users of the financial statements. Thus, it is important to define the primary government and determine what it comprises. A primary government is any state government or general purpose local government (municipality or county). A primary government is also a special-purpose government (for example, a school district or a park district) that meets all of the following criteria:
 
 a. It has a separately elected governing body.
 
 b. It is legally separate
 
 c. It is fiscally independent
 
A primary government consists of all the organizations that make up its legal entity. All funds, organizations, institutions, agencies, departments, and offices that are not legally separate are, for financial reporting purposes, part of a primary government. If an organization is part of a primary government, its financial data should be included with the financial data of the primary government.</label>

          xml:lang="en">Special revenue funds are used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects. The term proceeds of specific revenue sources establishes that one or more specific restricted or committed revenues should be the foundation for a special revenue fund. Those specific restricted or committed revenues may be initially received in another fund and subsequently distributed to a special revenue fund. Those amounts should not be recognized as revenue in the fund initially receiving them; however, those inflows should be recognized as revenue in the special revenue fund in which they will be expended in accordance with specified purposes. The restricted or committed proceeds of specific revenue sources should be expected to continue to comprise a substantial portion of the inflows reported in the fund. Other resources (investment earnings and transfers from other funds, for example) also may be reported in the fund if those resources are restricted, committed, or assigned to the specified purpose of the fund. A stabilization arrangement would satisfy the criteria to be reported as a separate special revenue fund only if the resources derive from a specific restricted or committed revenue source. Governments should discontinue reporting a special revenue fund, and instead report the fund’s remaining resources in the general fund, if the government no longer expects that a substantial portion of the inflows will derive from restricted or committed revenue sources. Resources restricted to expenditure for purposes normally financed from the general fund may be accounted for through the general fund provided that applicable legal requirements can be appropriately satisfied; and use of special revenue funds is not required unless they are legally mandated. The general fund of a blended component unit should be reported as a special revenue fund. Special revenue funds should not be used to account for resources held in trust for individuals, private organizations, or other governments. Governments should disclose in the notes to the financial statements the purpose for each major special revenue fund—identifying which revenues and other resources are reported in each of those funds.</label>
