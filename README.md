# Comprehensive Annual Financial Reporting Taxonomy (CAFR)
## Demonstration Release v1.0RC3

This is a Demonstration Release, to illustrate how data standards can be created and used in the municipal marketplace. The standards were developed by the [XBRL US State and Local Government Disclosure Modernization Working Group](https://xbrl.us/cafr) as a pilot to test the premise that standards can improve efficiencies by automating the process of creating, collecting, and analyzing government data. The Working Group [solicited feedback during a 60-day public review period ending March 18, 2019](https://xbrl.us/cafr-demo), and received comments related to:

-  **Definitions and references for the elements.** Are the definitions accurate? Are references appropriate? Should revisions or modifications be made?
-  **Coverage.** Are elements missing from these statements?
-  **General input.** Is the taxonomy structured appropriately? Is the documentation provided helpful and understandable?

The entry point for the latest release candidate for the taxonomy is posted on the [CAFR release page](https://github.com/xbrlus/cafr/releases), where you can also download archives (.zip or tar.gz) for local computer use.
