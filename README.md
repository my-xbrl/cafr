# Comprehensive Annual Financial Reporting Taxonomy (CAFR)
## Demonstration Release

This is a Demonstration Release, to illustrate how data standards can be created and used in the municipal marketplace. The standards were developed by the [XBRL US State and Local Government Disclosure Modernization Working Group](https://xbrl.us/cafr) as a pilot to test the premise that standards can improve efficiencies by automating the process of creating, collecting, and analyzing government data. The Working Group is [soliciting feedback during a 60-day public review period](https://xbrl.us/cafr-demo). Input is requested on:

-  **Definitions and references for the elements.** Are the definitions accurate? Are references appropriate? Should revisions or modifications be made?
-  **Coverage.** Are elements missing from these statements?
-  **General input.** Is the taxonomy structured appropriately? Is the documentation provided helpful and understandable?

The entry point for the taxonomy in the root of the repository is: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xbrlus/cafr **/master** /cafr_2019-01-16.xsd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xbrlus/cafr/master/cafr_2019-01-16.xsd). Consult the [CAFR release page](https://github.com/xbrlus/cafr/releases) for downloadable archives (.zip or tar.gz) and release-based entry points.
