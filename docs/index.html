</div><p>At least one-third of the 90,000 state and local governments in the United States produce annual financial reports. Due to the lack of standards for these reports, the ability to aggregate data and compare financial performance of governmental entities is limited. This working group seeks to address this problem by designing schemas and XBRL implementation(s) for open data reporting of state and local government actual financial results.</p>

<p>The scope of work includes Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs), Single Audit packages, state-mandated Annual Financial Reports (AFRs), and responses to relevant Census Bureau financial surveys. The group seeks to support relevant institutions gaining technical understanding and establishing best practices for disclosure modernization for the benefit of US state and local governments, as well as public pension systems.</p>
